Modify PHP Session storage path after Domain / Subdomain creation in Plesk

Originally this extension was intended as a simple solution to set the path of the PHP session files to a directory on the web space after creating a domain.

In the meantime a small GUI and other small options have been added and thanks to the help of the community there may also be other options, language files and other things (who knows).

I am always happy to receive comments and ideas, also in the Plesk Facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/plesk).

Take care and may Corona not be with you.
